				<h3>Take the Stage at UI5con</h3>

				<p>Speaking at UI5con is your chance for personal growth, allowing you to refine your communication skills,
					expand your professional network, and establish yourself as a thought leader within the UI5 community.</p>

				<p>At UI5con, it's not about big names - we prioritize unique ideas and fresh insights. We are eager to hear your voice,
					your distinct viewpoint, and your expertise. Proposing a talk for UI5con is not merely a stage to display your skills,
					but a chance to contribute to the growth and progression of the UI5 community.</p>

				<p>Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Submit your most innovative ideas by February 26, and you might find
					yourself sharing the stage with some of the brightest minds in the UI5 community.</p>

				<p>We're seeking a wide array of topics, including but not limited to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Innovative applications of UI5</li>
					<li>Efficient development tips and tricks</li>
					<li>Case studies and success stories</li>
					<li>Best practices for UI5 application architecture</li>
					<li>Insights on the future of UI5 and its evolving ecosystem</li>
					<li>Integrating UI5 with other technologies and platforms</li>
				</ul>

				<p>We welcome presentations of 20 minutes or longer sessions of 40 minutes, as well as hands-on workshops ranging
					from 60 to 120 minutes. All sessions must be conducted in English.</p>

				<h4>Required information:</h4>

				<p>When submitting your proposal, you’ll be asked to include the following information:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Title (max 75 characters)</li>
					<li>Session type: Options include a quickfire presentation (20 minutes),
						an in-depth presentation (40 minutes), or a hands-on workshop
						(60 minutes, 90 minutes, or 120 minutes)</li>
					<li>Presentation/workshop description (200-300 words)</li>
					<li>Remarks (optional): Add any further comments or information pertinent to your proposal
						that could aid us in decision making. You can also include suggestions for a new
						session format, or details about a proposed panel discussion and potential
						panelists can be included here.</li>
					<li>Speaker Name(s) and Contact Information: Depending on the session format selected,
						you can nominate up to four speakers. For the proposal, only the primary
						speaker's details are mandatory.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Tips for submitting a successful proposal:</h4>

				<p>To increase your chances of having your proposal accepted for UI5con, please consider the following tips:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Avoid marketing and sales language in your proposal.</li>
					<li>Offer original ideas and real-world scenarios, supported by relevant examples and knowledge transfer.
						This will help provide valuable insights to attendees.</li>
					<li>Include as much details as possible about your presentation. Explain why people should attend and
						what they will take away from it. Mention the specific products or topics you will cover,
						and if applicable, identify your target audience. </li>
					<li>Limit the scope of your presentation to fit within the allocated time (40 or 20 minutes).
						Instead of trying to cover everything about a framework, focus on a useful aspect, a particular technique,
						or walk through a simple program.</li>
					<li>Don’t assume that your company’s name buys you credibility. If you’re talking about something important
						that you have specific knowledge of because of what your company does, spell that out in the description.</li>
					<li>We value diversity and consider it seriously when reviewing proposals to ensure a broad range of speakers.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>It is important to note that UI5con caters to professionals, so keeping this audience in mind is essential.
					Additionally, all speakers are required to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which emphasizes the importance of
					creating an inclusive and respectful environment for all participants. Therefore, it is vital that your presentation,
					along with any supporting materials and informal commentary, is not only informative but also welcoming and
					respectful to everyone involved.</p>
