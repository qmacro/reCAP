					<dl>
						<dt>What are Early Bird Tickets?</dt>
						<dd>Early Bird Tickets are a limited number of tickets available for attendees who need to plan and arrange their
							travel well in advance, especially those traveling long distances.

							You can apply for Early Bird Tickets for each event through a single application form.</dd>

						<dt>Who qualifies for an Early Bird Ticket?</dt>
						<dd>Early Bird Tickets are intended for attendees who need to make travel and accommodation arrangements far in
							advance, usually those coming from far away who require early bookings to secure their plans.
							They ensure that those who genuinely need early confirmation for travel can avail themselves of this opportunity.</dd>

						<dt>How many Early Bird tickets are available for reCAP?</dt>
						<dd>There are only an extremely limited number of Early Bird tickets available.</dd>

						<dt>How do I apply for an Early Bird ticket and what is the deadline?</dt>
						<dd>To apply for an Early Bird Ticket, you need to complete a questionnaire form, which can be found
							<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1IYRlSjux-FvqoTNxg-9Yg8G4X2bq9e12pqV8dpIUYKI/edit">here</a>.

						<dt>What happens after I submit my Early Bird ticket application?</dt>
						<dd>After submitting your application, you will receive a notification about its status within 2 weeks.

							your travel details to the Code Connect team via email to confirm your ticket.</dd>

						<dt>Why do I need to provide travel arrangement proofs after my Early Bird ticket is confirmed?</dt>

							and ensures that it benefits those who truly need it for planning their travel.</dd>
