				<p>
					At reCAP, we're all about collaboration, community, and maybe just a little chaos (the good kind). That's why we're on the hunt for amazing people like you to join us as volunteers! Think of it as being part of a superhero squad—only your cape might be a lanyard.
					<br>
					As a reCAP volunteer, you'll be a key player in making this conference unforgettable. In return, we'll shower you with exclusive perks: access to the event, delicious food and drinks, a heartfelt thank-you gift, and, of course, our undying gratitude (we may even write you a sonnet).
				</p>

				<h3>Explore Our Volunteer Opportunities:</h3>

				<h4>Setup & Takedown</h4>

				<p>
					Love the smell of freshly printed signs and the thrill of room makeovers? Dive into the behind-the-scenes magic! Help us transform our venue before and after the event. You'll handle simple yet vital tasks like arranging signs, decorating rooms, and preparing the registration area. Pro tip: wear comfy shoes—you're in for some hands-on fun!
				</p>

				<h4>Registration</h4>

				<p>
					Be the welcoming face of reCAP—the one everyone remembers because you gave them their badge and a smile. You'll make check-in smooth, hand out badges like a pro, verify tickets, and field questions like a reCAP oracle. Bonus points for answering “Where's the restroom?” without missing a beat.
				</p>

				<h4>Moderator</h4>

				<p>
					Love the spotlight, but only when it's on someone else? This role's for you! Introduce speakers, keep sessions running like clockwork, and manage the flow of Q&A. Basically, you're the glue holding speakers, audience, technicians, and the reCAP team together. Yes, you're that important.
				</p>

				<h4>Photography & Video</h4>

				<p>
					Got an eye for the perfect shot or a knack for capturing those candid “aha” moments? Join us to document the magic of
					reCAP. Whether you're wielding a camera or crafting video content, youll help us relive the best moments long after the
					lights go down.

				</p>

				<h4>Join the #reCAP Dream Team!</h4>
				<p>
					Ready to make a difference and have a blast? Drop us an email with your name, your volunteer role of choice, and a short note about why you're excited to join us. We're counting the days until we get to welcome you to the team and share all the juicy details!
