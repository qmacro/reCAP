      "Combining the power of UI5 and CAP to implement server-side pre-rendering of UI5 artifacts is an exciting new concept. This session will introduce the initial idea of pre-rendering UI5 fragments and views using CAP, demonstrating how these two SAP frameworks can be combined to enhance their capabilities. I will share my approach to achieving this, along with ideas for further improvement. This presentation highlights the potential of leveraging UI5 and CAP together to elevate both frameworks to the next level.",

As soon as UI5 came around the corner, I started building Fiori applications and pushed UI5 to its limits. Since then I have been following the latest SAP Innovations which led me to Business Technology Platform (BTP) from in the early days when it still was called HANA Cloud Platform. This made me grow from a developer into an Solution Architect which I still love to comebine. As a developer and architect I focus on BTP, Fiori/WorkZone, Cloud Application Programming model, UI5 and ABAP. My goal is to share my experience as a developer and architect to help customers with: BTP, Work Zone, CAP, UI5, Fiori Elements and RAP",

Because I cannot access my on-premise OData-service".\n \nThe answer to this question is "Yes you can!".\n\nLet us have a look on how CAP (tools) and its documentation can help us to set up hybrid testing in VS Code.\nI will explain and demonstrate the hybrid testing configuration differences for both IDE\'s (SAP Business Application Studio - VS Code) and test and connect to a cloud and on-premise OData-service.\nLet\'s create 2 testing profiles for the SAP Business Application Studio and VS Code, so you can easily run your application from both IDE\'s.\n \nHope to see you there!',

      "SAP Sales and Service Cloud V2 introduces a modern, cloud-native CRM solution, but its extensibility is strictly limited to side-by-side extensions. For complex scenarios, SAP recommends using the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). But how well does CAP align with the requirements and capabilities of Sales and Service Cloud V2?\n\nIn this session, we will walk through a practical example of extending SAP Sales and Service Cloud V2 using CAP, highlighting the key technical aspects and architectural considerations. We will evaluate CAP’s capabilities in the context of common extension scenarios and compare them with the expectations set by the new SAP Sales and Service Cloud V2 platform.\n\nFinally, we will explore the broader implications of this shift—both for the evolution of CAP itself and for the SAP ecosystem. What challenges and opportunities does this approach bring? Join us for an insightful discussion on the future of SAP extensibility and its impact on developers and businesses.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- Understand the limitations of SAP Sales and Service Cloud V2 extensibility \n- Learn how to use CAP for building side-by-side extensions\n- Compare CAP’s capabilities with the requirements of complex CRM extensions\n- Discuss the broader implications of this approach on SAP’s technology landscape",

      'This session explores the evolution of the CAP Transactional Outbox towards a framework for ultimate resilience made up of general purpose task scheduling, hooks for implementing SAGA patterns, as well as means for handling unsuccessful workloads.\n\nFirst, the new CAP-native task queue allows to schedule arbitrary workloads, which we make use of ourselves for optimized outbox processing as well as adding resiliance to incoming workloads -- the so-called Inbox.\n\nSecond, the new, event-based API for registering callbacks for scheduled tasks allows to implement non-blocking distributed workflows, such as (1) accepting and immediately acknowledging an order, (2) reserving the necessary stock on remote systems via the transactional outbox, and (3) triggering the approval process on confirmation.\n\nFinally, we\'ll demonstrate how to implement and manage a robust Dead Letter Queue system that works seamlessly across both CAP Java and CAP Node.js applications, including (1) defining a secure CDS service for managing failed workloads, (2) implementing filtering mechanisms to identify truly "dead" tasks, (3) building reactivation and deletion capabilities for manual intervention, and (4) applying proper security constraints to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nTime permitting, we could take a brief look at how OpenTelemetry can be leveraged to monitor critical metrics such as cold entry counts, processing times, and message throughput -- all essential for maintaining healthy communication between microservices.',

    type: "hands_on",
    description:
      "Business applications will have asynchronous actions which can run in background, Decoupling these executions from the main execution stack bring more resilience to the applications. This can be done using any messaging service and when you are using SAP CAP framework this can be achieved flawlessly using CAP Outbox. Outbox is a feature that provides temporary storage for messages or events before they are processed and sent out to external systems. It is particularly useful for ensuring reliable event-driven communication and eventual consistency in distributed applications. \n\nWe also need to keep the application users informed about the status of these background tasks. For apps using Fiori Sites, Fiori notifications will be a perfect way to notify the user. Again, with CAP you don’t have to implement it from scratch, we can use cap-js/notifications and implement it in much lesser time. The @cap-js/notifications package is a CDS plugin that provides support for publishing business notifications in SAP Build WorkZone. \n\nSo to sum up, we will have a hands-on session to manage your asynchronous tasks using cap outbox and notify the users using notifications implemented by @cap-js/notifications  plugin.\nAre you interested, come let’s code it together.\n",

By following this pattern, partners and developers can align their custom implementations with a common structure that maximizes reusability, testability, and scalability.\n\nWe will walk through the key components of the Calesi Pattern, demonstrate how plugins can encapsulate domain-specific logic, and show how even third-party extensions benefit from adhering to the pattern.\n\nAttendees will gain practical insights into building loosely coupled, extensible integration layers, making it easier to onboard partners, reduce maintenance efforts, and accelerate innovation across use cases.",
